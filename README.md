# Check Your Czech - a service to practice Czech grammar

The idea of the service is to have a nice app that will help to selectively train some Czech grammar rules. 

Selectively is a key word as language services usually check the language knowledge in full. Whereas in reality people learn new language rule by rule, case by case, aspect by aspect. This service is supposed to give exercises like *"practice all the exceptions of second case plural for male animate gender"*.

## Plan of development

1. Add first exercise
2. Add more exercises
3. Add more languages
